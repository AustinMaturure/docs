Welcome to the "Build" section of the IOTA Wiki. This section is for developers interested in using the IOTA and Shimmer networks for decentralized applications, integrating their exchange, minting NFTs, and much more. Here, you can find all the available [Networks and Endpoints](/build/networks-endpoints/), links for all the available [Tools](/build/tools/), [APIS](/apis/welcome/), and all the documentation to communicate with the Layer 1 networks, build decentralized applications and interact with Layer 2 [smart contracts](#smart-contracts).

## Layer 1[​](#layer-1 "Direct link to Layer 1")

### IOTA SDK[​](#iota-sdk "Direct link to IOTA SDK")

You can use the [IOTA SDK](/iota-sdk/welcome/) to interact directly with the IOTA and Shimmer networks. The IOTA SDK offers a streamlined integration of IOTA functionality into your projects. It is available in [Rust](/iota-sdk/getting-started/rust/), [Node.js](/iota-sdk/getting-started/nodejs/), [Python](/iota-sdk/getting-started/python/) and [Wasm](/iota-sdk/getting-started/wasm/).

### Cli Wallet[​](#cli-wallet "Direct link to Cli Wallet")

The [cli-wallet](/cli-wallet/welcome/) is a stateful Command Line Interface wrapper for the IOTA SDK that allows you to create a wallet, create and manage accounts, send *value transactionsValue transactions either withdraw tokens from an address or deposit them to an address. Nodes verify these transactions to ensure that the sender owns the Shimmer tokens and that additional tokens are not generated. To do this, the following checks are performed: All Shimmer tokens withdrawn from an address are also deposited into one or more other addresses; the value of each transaction does not exceed the total global supply; signatures are valid.*, mint, burn, and receive native tokens and NFTs, and more.

### Identity[​](#identity "Direct link to Identity")

You can use the [IOTA Identity Framework](/identity.rs/welcome/) to create and manage [Self-Sovereign Identities (SSI)](/identity.rs/explanations/decentralized-identifiers/) for people, organizations, or any object in a GDPR-compliant, cost-efficient, and privacy-enabling manner.

## Layer 2[​](#layer-2 "Direct link to Layer 2")

### Smart Contracts[​](#smart-contracts "Direct link to Smart Contracts")

The [IOTA Smart Contracts (ISC)](/learn/smart-contracts/introduction/) bring scalable, flexible, and cost-effective smart contract functionality to the IOTA ecosystem. By anchoring multiple chains to the IOTA Tangle, ISC enables higher *throughputThe rate or capacity at which transactions or data can be processed or transmitted within a given timeframe by the network.* and lower fees than traditional single-chain solutions. Users have the freedom to create custom chains with control over gas fees and privacy settings, and the platform is virtual machine-agnostic, supporting both [Rust/Wasm](/isc/introduction/) and [Solidity/EVM](/isc/introduction/) smart contracts.
