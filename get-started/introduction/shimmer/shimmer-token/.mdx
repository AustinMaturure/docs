Similar to the [IOTA token](/get-started/introduction/iota/iota-token/), the Shimmer token (SMR) also acts as a medium for value exchange, has no *inflationThe process of increasing the total supply of a cryptocurrency by minting or creating new tokens.*, and is not subject to any fees. However, unlike the IOTA token, SMR could not be bought beforehand in an ICO but was only distributed to IOTA token holders who staked their tokens during the Shimmer staking periods on the IOTA mainnet.

Note that the smallest denomination of SMR is called "glow" with 6 decimal points. The total supply consists therefore out of 1,813,620,509 SMR tokens or 1,813,620,509,061,365 glow.

## Supply & Distribution[​](#supply--distribution "Direct link to Supply & Distribution")

The initial supply of SMR was distributed in the following way:

| Allocation       | Percentage | # of SMR Tokens | Purpose                                                                                                                           |
| ---------------- | ---------- | --------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| IOTA Stakers     | 80%        | 1,450,896,407   | Rewarded to IOTA token holders who staked their tokens on the IOTA mainnet.                                                       |
| Community DAO    | 10%        | 181,362,051     | To foster community involvement and governance, enabling members to contribute to the Shimmer ecosystem's development and growth. |
| Tangle Ecosystem | 10%        | 181,362,051     | To support and incentivize projects that leverage the IOTA Tangle, contributing to the ecosystem's development.                   |
